Substance Test
=====

A simple testing facility that lets you test CommonJS compatible modules. It works in browser + Node.js environments.

Check out the new [Substance.Sandbox](http://github.com/substance/sandbox) for a good starting point. We'll add documentation as we go. Keep in mind Substance.Test is still a work in progress.
