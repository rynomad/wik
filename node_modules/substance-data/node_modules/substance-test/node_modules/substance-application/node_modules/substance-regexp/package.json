In our case we needed to know the character positions of the matched word boundaries. Inspired by Phython and Ruby we came up with something that feels more natural, but without adding any magic.\n\n```js\nvar wordBounds = new Substance.RegExp(/.\\w/g);\nvar matches = wordBounds.match(str);\n```\n\nMuch better. Now if our cursor were at position 6 and we wanted to jump to next word bound we could find out the position by inspecting the normalized matches.\n\n```js\nvar cursorPos = 6;\nvar nextBound = _.find(matches, function(m) {\n  return m.index>charPos;\n}).index;\n```\n\nEasy. If you want to see it in action have a look at the brand-new [Selection API](https://github.com/substance/document/blob/master/src/selection.js).\n",
